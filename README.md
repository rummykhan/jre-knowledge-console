# Unofficial Joe Rogan knowledge console

#### Note:  Episodes updated as of March 2, 2021

### Description
I loved jre podcasts full of knowledge, but these podcasts are so many and I don't know which podcast I should watch.
This is an attempt to create a centralized repo for JRE podcasts, a repo that would be indexed (perhaps solr), searchable for general public.
I'll create a web ui in near future for public access to watch the podcasts of their own interests.

### Tech used

* SpringBoot 2.4.3
* MongoDB
